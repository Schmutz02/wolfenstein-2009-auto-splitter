## About

Works by default with both 100% and Any% splits on [Speedrun.com page](https://www.speedrun.com/wolfenstein/resources). To use other splits see [Settings](#settings).<br>

It works by splitting when the mission complete dossier is detected and certain map transitions ([Settings for detail](#settings)).<br>
Advantage of this is flexible routing, the path you take isn't hard-coded. However if you forget something and need to go back it may split depending on settings.

## Settings

- **Using splits**<br>
  *Disable if you don't use splits and only want automatic start, stop and reset.*
  - **Split hub travel**<br>
  *Disable if you only use splits when completing a level.*
  - **Mid level splits**<br>
  *Disable if you don't want mid level splits. i.e. Castle -> Castle Top.*

## Bugs

***WILL NOT HAPPEN MID RUN***<br>
If you notice splits occurring rapidly, just re-launch the game and it will work. Very rarely the map pointer won't read correctly despite the proper data being there.
